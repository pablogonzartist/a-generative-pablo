    <H3> Instructions Drawing 1 <br>
    </H3>
    <div class="description"><p> 
    1) place one dot on the paper. <br>
    2) place another dot horizontally across from this first dot. <br>
    3) connect the two dots by creating an arc shape: one above, one below. It should look like a lemon when you do this. <br>
    4) once this is done, draw a circle in the center of the lemon shape. make sure the top of the circle and the bottom are touching the lemon shape from the inside. <br>
    5) once this is done, draw a smaller circle within that circle. Make sure its small like a pea. <br>
    6) using your pencil, measure the width of the lemon shape. measure out the distance of this unit of measurement and repeat steps 1-6. </p></div>
    <H3> Instructions Drawing 2 </H3>
    <div class="description"><p> 1) below these two lemon shapes, draw a triangle. Make sure the left and right sides are longer than the bottom. <br>
    2) on the bottom line of that triangle, circle in two small circles. Make sure they are small, and evenly spaced out. <br>
    <H3> Instructions Drawing 3 </H3>
    <div class="description"><p> 1) draw one line below drawing two. <br>
    2) using one end, draw an arc that is thinner than the arc you made in drawing 1. it should look like a sunset in a horizon. <br>
    3) do one right below it, so it forms a very very thin lemon. <br>
    4) YOU HAVE FINISHED ALL THE DRAWINGs! CONGRATS! <br>
