    <div class="description"><p> Singer, songwriter, producer, and creative force majeure, Icelandic artist Björk opened up her archives to reimagine choral arrangements created over the course of her career in a singular, AI-empowered installation work.

        Made in collaboration with New York’s design-centric Sister City hotel and Microsoft, the result is Kórsafn—an AI-powered composition that builds on the generative soundscape concept that Sister City launched with Julianna Barwick in 2019. In Icelandic, “kór” = “choral,” and “safn” = “archives.” </p></div>
